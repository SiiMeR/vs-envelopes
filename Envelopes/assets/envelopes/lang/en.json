You can write a letter, put it into an envelope, optionally seal it with a wax (you first have to make a wax seal stamp and engrave it with a design), optionally fill in the From/To fields on the back of the envelope, and send it off. The recipient can then read the letter by opening the envelope. Wax can be scraped off the envelope by using a knife on it, making the envelope reusable."
